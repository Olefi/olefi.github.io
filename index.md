## 🚀 Professional Brand Statement (Data Scientist/Engineer)
I am an analytical professional with a unique trajectory, having transitioned from **Data Scientist at Lombard Insurance** to specializing in **Data Engineering and Cloud Development**. My foundation in production data science gives me crucial insight into modeling needs and data quality requirements. I leverage this experience, combined with intensive training in **ETL pipeline design, containerization (Docker), and full-stack data solutions**, to build robust data infrastructure. I am driven by automating complex data workflows and am currently seeking **Data Engineer** roles where I can build reliable, scalable data platforms using Python, SQL, and Cloud technologies.
